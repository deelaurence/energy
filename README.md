# JusKel - The Sustainability Finance Hub

## Vision

JusKel is an AI-driven platform that bridges the gap between ESG progress and accessible finance for UK SMEs. We transform sustainability into financial benefit.

## The Problem

Across the UK, small and mid-sized businesses face three critical barriers:

1. **Discovery Gap**: SMEs struggle to understand what sustainability improvements matter for their business, as every business has different environmental impacts.

2. **Funding Fragmentation**: Green grants, impact funds, bank products, and government incentives are scattered across multiple platforms with complex eligibility rules and evidence requirements.

3. **Financial Invisibility**: Sustainability progress isn't reflected in credit scoring. Lenders overlook real-time gains like reduced energy intensity, traceable sourcing, or audited waste reduction, leaving green financing largely untapped.

## Our Solution

JusKel connects:
- **Open banking insights** + company filings
- **Verified sustainability metrics** + supply-chain data
- **Live ESG scoring** + AI-driven funding matches

This creates a single platform where:
- SMEs get instant access to tailored green finance opportunities
- Lenders receive decision-grade ESG data for underwriting
- Sustainability improvements translate directly into reduced cost of capital

## Core Features (MVP)
